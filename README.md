# Restrictive Measures Algorithmic Solution
a C# console app game to play with a partner

The RMAS is a C# ConsoleApp game for caging a partner. There is no explicit imagery or content aside from text stating names of things like "user caged" or "phallic photos count". 

This project is just a person project I did for my partner and isn't really aimed towards some higher goal. The purpose of open sourcing this is for me to test out how GitHub works.

Run the `Program.cs` file to start the program and type the name of a user (a new user is created if you type a user which doesn't already exist). Users store separate information meaning you can run the program for multiple users easily. All information is regularly saved where you can shut down the program at any time without any loss of information.

Possible features I'd like to include in the future
- [ ] Time Bending
    - Ability to bend time frame (caging period) by 15 minutes in either direction in exchange for some tokens
