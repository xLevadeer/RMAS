a C# console app game to play with a partner

The RMAS is a C# ConsoleApp game for caging a partner. There is no explicit imagery or content aside from text stating names of things like "user caged" or "phallic photos count". 

Run the `Program.cs` file to start the program and type the name of a user (a new user is created if you type a user which doesn't already exist). Users store separate information meaning you can run the program for multiple users easily. All information is regularly saved where you can shut down the program at any time without any loss of information.
